To use the Custom directory, create a directory structure that matches the base Gitorade application
and use the namespace in the template:

* Sadekbaroudi\Gitorade\Custom\{$pathToFile}

Currently, only Command will be implicitly picked up by the application. This will allow you to add
new Commands without having to modify the core directories
